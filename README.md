# Overview
This project is to create a music playlist application that stores information in the cloud. This project was to create something that I would want to have as a personal application as well as to get more hands on experience working with databases and API calls. Below is a video demo of how this app works. This is a bare bones application and still has a long way to go before completion, but shows fundamentals of the project working.
